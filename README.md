# Foreword
This read me file seems fairly redundant because I didn't make any decisions. The outline for this assignment pretty much removed any decision making.

# Purpose of the Database
The database generated by `create_tables.py` enables Sparkify to efficiently analyze the user data relating to user activity whilst using their app. Specifically, it optimises the analysis of what users are listening to.

# Architectural decisions 
State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.

Using a star schema simplifies the queries and allows fast aggregations. The tables are structured such that a member of the analytics team can quickly identify the total number of songs played by a user using a single join. Similarly, one could also return an artists most popular songs using only 2 joins (The second being significantly shorter).

## Decisions for tables

I assumed that the purpose of the time table was to simplify queries when searching for windows, so the hour, day, week, month and year values are all integers. and the primary key is just a varchar to hold the original timestamp.

The users table holds 




# Optional: Query examples for song play analysis 
So I'm not really sure what else I'm meant to write in this to prove that I didn't plagiarise the work so here's a query I've made up.

So for each artist I want to list their songs by most played to least played. However, as the data I have is an incomplete dataset, instead I'll simulate this using a similar query. For each user return the sessions in order of number of songs listened to from most to least. 


```SQL
SELECT first_name, last_name, songs_in_session 
FROM users 
	JOIN 
	(SELECT COUNT(session_id) as songs_in_session, user_id 
	FROM songplays
		JOIN time on songplays.start_time = time.start_time
	
	GROUP BY user_id, session_id 
	ORDER BY user_id, songs_in_session DESC) 
AS us ON users.user_id = us.user_id;
```
